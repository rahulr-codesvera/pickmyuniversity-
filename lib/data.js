The President of the country said many times that the most important resource that Kyrgyzstan possesses is a human resource. I could not disagree with this, we do not have those natural resources that some of our neighbors and partners have, but we have beautiful mountains, rivers of the lake and of course young, energetic people who can do everything, but only if they sincerely want it . And our institute helps these young people realize their dreams. I would like to note that we have done and are doing everything possible to ensure that our university is comfortable. I think that only in a favorable – comfortable environment we can achieve good results, and we are ready to provide this environment to all our students today.",
